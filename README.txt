1. For Brainstorm, did you use Freesurfer on the selected subject and extract 
the head model for this specific subject? How did you align the electrodes 
to the head model. I do not believe the scanned location of the electrodes 
were available.

2. What is the advantage of using a surface Atlas such as Desikan-Killiany 
compared to a volumetric one (since you are using Loreta anyway).

3. Do the function work for continuous data?

4. OK to do eLoreta on a mesh instead of a volume?

5. What about the additional connectivity measures in one of the function
